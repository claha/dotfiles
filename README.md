# dotfiles

To install these dotfiles simply run:

```bash
stow emacs git i3 mpv qutebrowser
```

For everything to work correctly a few packages are needed, listed [here](packages.txt).
The package names are currently compatible with `pacman` but most packages should
also work with other package managers suchs as `apt`, `yum` etc.
